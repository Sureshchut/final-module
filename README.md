**BiriyaniToken README**

**Description:**
BiriyaniToken is a Solidity smart contract developed on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to mint, transfer, burn tokens, and redeem portions of biriyani based on their token holdings.

**Features:**
1. **ERC20 Compatibility:** BiriyaniToken is ERC20 compliant, enabling seamless integration with existing decentralized applications (dApps) and wallets.
2. **Minting:** Only the contract owner can mint new tokens, ensuring controlled token supply.
3. **Transfer Tokens:** Users can transfer tokens to other addresses by calling the `transferTokens` function.
4. **Burning Tokens:** Users can burn their tokens using the `burnTokens` function, reducing the total token supply.
5. **Redeeming Biriyani:** Users can redeem portions of biriyani by exchanging tokens for biriyani. The contract owner specifies the price and portion size of each type of biriyani (e.g., Chicken Biriyani, Mutton Biriyani) during contract deployment. Once redeemed, the tokens are burned, and the redeemed biriyani portions are tracked.

**Smart Contract Functions:**
- `constructor`: Initializes the contract with predefined biriyani types, prices, and portions.
- `mint`: Allows the contract owner to mint new tokens and assign them to a specified account.
- `transferTokens`: Enables users to transfer tokens to another address.
- `burnTokens`: Allows users to burn their tokens.
- `redeemBiriyani`: Allows users to redeem portions of biriyani in exchange for tokens.

**Events:**
- `LogMessage`: Logs general messages for informational purposes.
- `BiriyaniRedeemed`: Logs details when a user redeems biriyani, including the account address, biriyani type, and portion size.

**Security Considerations:**
- **Ownership:** Ensure that ownership privileges are managed securely to prevent unauthorized access to critical functions such as minting tokens.
- **Input Validation:** Validate user inputs thoroughly to prevent potential vulnerabilities such as integer overflow, underflow, and reentrancy attacks.
- **External Calls:** Be cautious when making external calls to other contracts to avoid potential security risks.
